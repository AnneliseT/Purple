      <h3>About us</h3>

      Purple is an expense tracking application that allows the users to customize expenditure categories and view textual
      and graphical summaries of their expenses. There will be a login page, a user homepage, a user spending page, and a
      user budgeting page. The user will add their income and spending information into the app and will be able to view
      textual and graphical summaries of their expenditures. They will also be able to group their expenditures by
      adding/editing spending categories.<br>

      <h3>User Home Page</h3>
      The primary goal of the user homepage is to give an overview of a userâ€™s expenses for the week and a summary of
      their key spending metrics such as total expenditures, highest expense category, and change in spending from
      previous weeks. From the home page users can navigate to the Spending and Budgeting pages.<br>
      <h3>Spending</h3>
      In the Spending section of the app the user will be able to add main expenditure categories such as Food, Bills, and
      Travel. They will then be able to drill down into these categories and view their expenses and expense summaries for
      each category. These categories can have additional sub-categories. For example, the Bills category may be further
      subdivided into Medical, Car, Utilities, and School groups. Within the different categories users will be able to
      add their transaction information.<br>
      <h3>Bar and Pie Chart</h3>
      Provide a graphical summary of expenditures for users. Enjoy!
